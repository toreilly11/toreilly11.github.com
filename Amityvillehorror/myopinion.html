    <h2>My belief on the "hauntings"</h2>
    <p>I believe the hauntings were real, but only to an extent. The events on the night the Defeos were murdered have not been completely explained to this day, I certainly think there was something paranormal going on that night. I do not think that Ronald Defeo would murder his family so systematically if he did so out of rage, as is theorized. Also, there were six members of the family killed, they must have heard the gunshots, but why didn't they try to run? There were no signs of a struggle and no drugs found in their systems. Why would at least one of them not attempt to call the police or escape? These things were never fully explained, leading to my conclusion that something supernatural must have been involved. I do think the Lutzes expiereced some paranormal events, but I think their story is blown way out of proportion and much to exaggerated to be the truth. I believe some parts to be true, but some of their claims are simply too far-fetched and over the top.</p>

    <div id="locationpic"><h2>Do I think the son should have been convicted?</h2>
    <p> I do think Ronald Defeo was rightly imprisioned, he may not have committed the murders consciously but it is better that he is somewhere he cannot harm anyone. I do think his treatment was very unjust and he should have received mental help, whether he committed the murders knowingly or not.</p></div>
    <div id="locationpic2"><h2>Thoughts on the movies?</h2><p>I really love horror movies, horror is my favorite genre and I could honestly watch scary movies all the time. So of course I liked the three Amityville Horror movies I featured on this site. Sure, a couple were a little cheesy, and not exactly true to the facts but I still would definitely watch them again.</p></div>

    <p> They don't have anything to do with the murders, they're just a good band whose name was inspired by Amityville.</p><img src="http://resources.wimpmusic.com/images/3c069b97/aa66/48e2/ae4f/561be356322a/160x160.jpg"/></div>
