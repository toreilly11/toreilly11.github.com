    <h2>Were the hautings real?</h2>
    <p>Some conspiracy theoritsts and ghost hunters believe the house that isnpired so many movies is actually haunted by evil spriits. Many believe Ronald Defeo must have been possessed by the devil or another type of evil spirit. They say that the murders cannot have been committed by someone in their right mind, and on top of that Ronald's story has never been quite clear. This suspicion of supernatural activity was reinforced by the Lutz' claims of eerie events; George Lutz began acing uncharacteristically violent and claims that he mysteriously woke at 3:15 a.m. almost every day — around the same time the DeFeo murders were believed to have occured. "There were ... odors in the house that came and went," Lutz says. "There were sounds. The front door would slam shut in the middle of the night.... I couldn't get warm in the house for many days." The Lutz also asked a priest, Father Ray Pecoraro, to bless the house in order to get rid of the supposed spirits. According to Lutz, the priest had said that he felt an unseen hand hit him while he was in the sewing room and heard a voice say "Get out." Then, Pecoraro became ill with flu-like symptoms and his hands began to bleed. 28 Days after moving in the family fled, leaving all their belongings behind, and never returned. Some believe that Ronald Defeo was simply mentally insane, and that the Lutz' story is just a money-making scheme. Others however, honestly believe that something sinister and otherworldly haunts the house in Amityville, NY.</p>

    <h2>Excerpts from ghost hunter Lorraine Warren's story</h2><p>Alongside her late husband, demonologist Ed Warren, clairvoyant Lorraine (featured on the right) investigated some of the most famous and infamous paranormal hauntings around. Her most notable cases have inspired plenty of frightening flicks, including 1979's "The Amityville Horror" (as well as the 2005 remake) and next week's scream-inducer, "The Conjuring."

At "The Conjuring" press junket in San Francisco, Yahoo Movies recently had the chance to speak with Warren, now 86-years-old. We asked Warren how the 1971 case of the Perron family in Harrisville, Rhode Island, which inspired "The Conjuring," compares to the horror the Lutz family experienced in Amityville, New York back in the mid 70s.

Warren instinctively laughed, as if there is no comparison at all.

"Amityville was horrible, honey. It was absolutely horrible," said Warren. "It followed us right straight across the country. I don't even like to talk about it. I will never go in the Amityville house ever again. You don't know how long my career is; that's the only one."

Warren's career is indeed long, as she and Ed founded the New England Society for Psychic Research in 1952, and have over 4,000 cases in their files. So when Warren says that the Amityville house is the one haunted house she won't return to, it's apparent something terrifying went down there.

That something horrific did occur at the house is not in dispute. On November 13, 1974, 23-year-old Ronald DeFeo Jr. murdered his parents, two brothers, and two sisters. But that's not what inspired the film, and subsequent sequels.

About a year later, George and Kathy Lutz moved into the house at 112 Ocean Avenue with Kathy's three children. Not surprisingly, the Lutzes got a great deal on the house, which was ironically called High Hopes.

But according to the Lutzes, after moving into the house, evil forces started moving the furniture (most of which was left over from the DeFeos), strange welts showed up on Kathy's body, demonic red eyes peered around corners, and general paranormal terrorizing occurred. The Lutz finally evacuated High Hopes after only 28 days.

The Warrens were some of the only investigators to look into the case. And while many claim the whole story is a hoax, it's obvious in talking to Lorraine that she remains a firm believer.</p></div>

    <h2><strong>Excerpts from the Lutz' Story</strong></h2>
    <div id="lutz">
<p>The family moved in anyway, but within days they began to notice strange phenomena.

"There were ... odors in the house that came and went," Lutz says. "There were sounds. The front door would slam shut in the middle of the night.... I couldn't get warm in the house for many days."

Lutz says the family kept the fireplace burning day and night in a futile attempt to stay warm, and found strange gelatinous drops on the carpet when they woke up in the morning. At times, he claims, his wife was physically transformed into an old woman, with the face, hair and wrinkles of a 90-year-old.

Lutz claims that he mysteriously woke at 3:15 a.m. almost every day — around the same time the DeFeo murders were believed to have happened. One night, he says, he heard his children's beds "slamming up and down on the floor" above him but he was unable to do anything because he was immobilized in bed by an unseen force. Later that night, he woke to see his wife levitating and moving across the bed, he says.

The next morning, just 28 days after they moved in, the Lutz family fled the house, leaving their clothes in the closets and food in the refrigerator. If the family had not left, Lutz says, he believes something horrible would have happened. "I try not to think about it," he says.</p>
