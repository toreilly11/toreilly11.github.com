<h1> Quotes </h1>
<ul>
	<em<li> "People say you should always do the right thing, 			but sometimes there is no right thing, and then you 	just have to pick the sin you can live with." </li></em>

    <em><li>"This is your open letter, something to remember,
We can still keep on fighting even though life is not forever."
</li></em>

	<em><li>"And I bet she told a million people that she'd stay in touch, But all the little promises they don't mean much, When there's memories to be made."

	<em><li>"Just take it all, my heart, my mind, my every word from out of my lungs.
My every breath and every thought, and every word I've ever sung."</li></em>

	<em><li>"Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
Landed in a very common crisis
Everything's in order in a black hole.
Nothing seems as pretty as the past though."</li></em>

	<em><li>"Your pasttimes consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged"</li></em>
   
	
</ul>
